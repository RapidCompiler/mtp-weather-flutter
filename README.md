# mtp_weather

This app is part of my first IoT project wherein, weather data at Mettupalayam is recorded from a Raspberry Pi and an Arduino Board. I built this entire app using flutter and dart. At present, this app **does not** run on iOS devices. It has been optimized to run on Android devices with a screen pixel resolution of 1080 x 2340 (for videos). However, when it comes to the functionality, there would be no issues when it runs on Android devices that do not have the above mentioned pixel resolution.
